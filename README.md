# Top Cancelled

## General Info
This program uses a Twitter API and webscraping to determine the most cancelled users. Data is stored in a SQL database and sentiment analysis is used on trending tweets to determine which users are most cancelled. The frontend is written with HTML and CSS and the Bootstrap framework is used. The data on the most cancelled users is then displayed in a table with the use of the web framework Flask. Other features include a page that displays random tweets from all over the world.
